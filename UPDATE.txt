1. Placing tarball: as always, take the tar-ball of the new  version 1.3.2, and follow the 
standard MPI deployment procedure.  Consult the instructions from INSTALL.txt 
about placing war file if you haveforgotte.

2. Adjusting shhaa.xml  you need to set "sso action" and "slo action". E.g for lux17
the should look as follows: 
<sso action="lI">https://lux17.mpi.nl/Shibboleth.sso/Login</sso> 
<slo action="lO">https://lux17.mpi.nl/Shibboleth.sso/Logout</slo> 


For the other servers the sysadmins should know their values and place them in the shhaa.xml.


3. If the application is succesfully deployed, you will get the jsp page after requesting

<server uri>/ds/webannotator

On this web-page there is a number of test GET requests there which you can send if you want 
to check if it works. Ask Olha to add you  providing with your shibboleth  remote ID. 
If you are in the DB you should be able to perform any request, except may be
getting annotation. If you have read access to the test annotation, 
you will get it. Ask Olha to test POST, PUT, DELETE or do it youself consulting "Testing" 
section in INSTAL.txt.
