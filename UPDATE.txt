This time only webannotator-basic must be updated. It will be used for adjusting the 
frontend while the previous shibbolised backend will be still running with the previous version
of the front-end, to be tested by our partners from Tartu.

1. Placing tarball: take the tar-ball of the new  version 1.5, and follow the 
standard MPI deployment procedure, for webannotator-basic.  
Consult the instructions from INSTALL.txt  about placing war file if you have forgotten.

2. The web.xml stays intact  because currently it is set for basic authentication.

3. The id of one cached representation (used in the welcome jsp page as an example) 
must be changed in the database.  

Since there is no API for changing IDs, dearest latadmin, pls, do it.

UPDATE cached_representation SET external_id = 
'b0d3f18c-eecf-40ea-9979-eecbbdca7d68' WHERE external_id='654809f6-1202-4073-86b8-a1f6fe0f2409';

This id is already set up in the jsp page, so no changes should be done there.

4. Nothing is to be update in settings (web.xml, context.xml) and the database.
