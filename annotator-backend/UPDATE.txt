1. Placing tarball: as always, take the tar-ball of the new  version 1.1, and follow the 
standard MPI deployment procedure.  Consult the instructions from INSTALL.txt 
about placing war file if you haveforgotte.

2. Adjusting shhaa.xml:  you need to set "sso action" and "slo action". E.g.
for lux16 they look as follows:
<sso action="lI">{$shibLI}</sso> 
<slo action="lO">{$shibLI}</slo> 

where the values of the variables are set by maven to  
http://lux16.mpi.nl/Shibboleth.sso/Login 
 and 
 http://lux16.mpi.nl/Shibboleth.sso/Logout</shibLO> 
 respectively


For the other servers the sysadmins should know their values and place them in the shhaa.xml.

3. This time the dasish database on lux17 is changed because I have removed some obsolete columns
and added a new one "account" for principals. Its values are "admin", "developer", "user". 
Remove the databse and copy the database from lux16 to lux17. 

4. If the application is succesfully deployed, you will get the jsp page after requesting

<server uri>/ds/webannotator

On this web-page there is a number of test GET requests there which you can send if you want 
to check if it works. If you are not in the DB yet, any request
will end up with the Server  error message "the logged-in-user". Ask Olha to add you 
providing with your shibboleth  remote ID. If you are in the DB you should be able to perform any request, except may be
getting annotation. If you have read access to the test annotation, 
you will get it. Ask Olha to test POST, PUT, DELETE or do it youself consulting "Testing" 
section in INSTAL.txt.
