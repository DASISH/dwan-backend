Placing tarball: take the tar-ball of the new  version 1.6.1-basic-authentication, and follow the 
standard MPI deployment procedure. The "current-nonshib" should link to this package.

No changings are to be done in context.xml and in the data-base because they are the same as
for the sibboleth version, abd it works.

The splitting between logging of shibboleth and basic versions will be implemented in 
next deployments
